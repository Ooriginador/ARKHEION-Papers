    "title": "ARKHEION AGI 2.0 — Conscious AI System with Quantum-Inspired Processing and Holographic Memory",
    "description": "ARKHEION AGI 2.0 is a comprehensive artificial general intelligence framework comprising 586K LOC Python, 21K LOC C++, and 18K LOC Rust. This release includes 50 academic papers (252 pages) documenting the system's architecture, from quantum-inspired processing and holographic compression to integrated information theory (IIT 4.0) consciousness modeling. Key components: (1) Quantum-inspired processor with AdS/CFT-based compression, (2) HUAM hierarchical memory with holographic encoding, (3) IIT consciousness engine with φ computation, (4) HTCV2 ternary compression achieving 51,929:1, (5) Forge runtime in Rust, (6) Bio-synthetic neural networks on AMD ROCm. All papers include rigorous epistemological notes distinguishing heuristic design metaphors from empirically measured results.",

    "notes": "This work is a collection of 50 working papers documenting the ARKHEION AGI 2.0 system. Papers follow a strict epistemological framework distinguishing heuristic design metaphors from empirically measured results. Quantum processing is simulated classically (not on quantum hardware). Benchmarks performed on AMD Radeon RX 6600M (RDNA2, gfx1030) with ROCm 6.2.2."
